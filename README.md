## Dependencies

1. **Move Dependencies to Game Folder:**
   - Locate the `dependencies` folder in the repository.
   - Move all files from the `dependencies` folder into your game folder.

*Note: Ensure all necessary files from the dependencies folder are moved to your game folder for proper functionality. If you are using a SAMP version other than 0.3.7 R1, make sure to download and use the appropriate version of SAMPFUNCS from [Blasthack](https://www.blast.hk).*

## Local server setup
Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, follow these steps to install Python:

1. **Download Python:** 
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version compatible with your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

Once Python is installed, proceed with setting up the local server:

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Install the libretranslate package
     ```
     pip install libretranslate
     ```
   - Change directory to the `server` folder where the server files are located. Use the `cd` command followed by the path to the `server` directory. For example:
     ```
     cd path/to/server
     ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   - After installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running the `main.py` file.
   - Execute the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Verify Server Setup:**
   - Once the server is running, you should see a message indicating that the server is running successfully and listening for incoming connections:
   ```
   ======== Running on http://127.0.0.1:9550 ========
   (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

If you see such a message - you can start using the script (console must remain open).

By default only the English and Russian language packages are used, if you want to add the rest, edit the language list (LOAD_ONLY) in main.py.
